# OpenWorld
## A Free Multiplayer Mod For Rimworld.

Open world is a work in progress mod that aims to achieve a fun and natural multiplayer experience in rimworld. With it, you can experience all your normal and casual adventures that you would in a singleplayer, but now connected with a bunch of other players living the same as you do.

You can choose to help each other, by providing support, or to transform into a world wide known enemy for all the players of the planet. There are no rules.

Attention! This is a work in progress mod! Things are prone to breaking! 

Attention! Needs .Net 6.0 or newer to work!

**Things to know before using?**
- To host a private server you will need to a dedicated port for your server to comunicate! I can't guide everyone on how to do this as it varies per internet provider / router. So you might need to follow a tutorial to achieve it.
- The server files include a readme explaining how to setup the server.

**Found a bug?**
- First check you are using the latest version, then, please, submit it! By doing so you are helping not only me but also every other user of this program. It helps out a ton!
