The server distributes the files in 4 different parts.
- Mods
- Players
- Server Settings
- World Settings

Mods:
If you want to play with mods, copy your essential mods, the ones you will be forcing your players to use, in the "Mods" folder. Restart your server if your mods folder is missing.

You can also place whitelisted mods in the "Whitelisted Mods" folder. This are mods that are allowed, but not essential to play in the server. This mods may include graphic or sound mods.

Players:
All the player files are stored in the "Players" folder, this files contain all the data of each player, and they can't be modified by normal means, trying to do so will probably result in permanent file corruption for said player. If you want to erase a player from the server, simply delete this file and upon restarting, the player will no longer be listed.

Please DO NOT manually create player files. Doing so will cause the server to crash on load.

Server Settings:
This file contains all the server configuration parameters that you can adjust as a server owner. The list of options will grow as time comes. In this file, you MUST NOT forget to change the configuration of the IP and Port used to your liking or the server might not start at all.

World Settings:
This file contains all the world configurables. It comes with default parameters, so you might adjust them to your liking, changing this file requires all players, new and old, to create a new game to prevent map mismatching, although you should not need to change this file again after doing it at first world creation.
